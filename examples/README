This directory contains a number of examples that illustrate the use of GTSAM:

SimpleRotation:  a super-simple example of optimizing a single rotation according to a single prior

Kalman Filter Examples
======================
elaboratePoint2KalmanFilter: simple linear Kalman filter on a moving 2D point, but done using factor graphs
easyPoint2KalmanFilter: uses the cool generic templated Kalman filter class to do the same
fullStateKalmanFilter: simple 1D example with a full-state filter
errorStateKalmanFilter: simple 1D example of a moving target measured by a accelerometer, incl. drift-rate bias

2D Pose SLAM 
============
LocalizationExample.cpp: modeling robot motion
LocalizationExample2.cpp: example with GPS like measurements
Pose2SLAMExample: A 2D Pose SLAM example using the predefined typedefs in gtsam/slam/pose2SLAM.h
Pose2SLAMExample_advanced: same, but uses an Optimizer object
Pose2SLAMwSPCG: solve a simple 3 by 3 grid of Pose2 SLAM problem by using easy SPCG interface

Planar SLAM with landmarks
==========================
PlanarSLAMExample: simple robotics example using the pre-built planar SLAM domain
PlanarSLAMExample_selfcontained: simple robotics example with all typedefs internal to this script.

Visual SLAM
===========
CameraResectioning.cpp: An example of gtsam for solving the camera resectioning problem
The directory vSLAMexample includes 2 simple examples using GTSAM:
- vSFMexample using visualSLAM in for structure-from-motion (SFM), and
- vISAMexample using visualSLAM and ISAM for incremental SLAM updates
See the separate README file there.

Undirected Graphical Models (UGM)
=================================
The best representation for a Markov Random Field is a factor graph :-)
This is illustrated with some discrete examples from the UGM MATLAB toolbox, which
can be found at http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/UGM
