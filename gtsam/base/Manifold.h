/**
 * Concept check class for Manifold types
 * Requires a mapping between a linear tangent space and the underlying
 * manifold, of which Lie is a specialization.
 *
 * The necessary functions to implement for Manifold are defined
 * below with additional details as to the interface.  The
 * concept checking function in class Manifold will check whether or not
 * the function exists and throw compile-time errors.
 *
 * A manifold defines a space in which there is a notion of a linear tangent space
 * that can be centered around a given point on the manifold.  These nonlinear
 * spaces may have such properties as wrapping around (as is the case with rotations),
 * which might make linear operations on parameters not return a viable element of
 * the manifold.
 *
 * We perform optimization by computing a linear delta in the tangent space of the
 * current estimate, and then apply this change using a retraction operation, which
 * maps the change in tangent space back to the manifold itself.
 *
 * There may be multiple possible retractions for a given manifold, which can be chosen
 * between depending on the computational complexity.  The important criteria for
 * the creation for the retract and localCoordinates functions is that they be
 * inverse operations.
 *
 * Returns dimensionality of the tangent space, which may be smaller than the number
 * of nonlinear parameters.
 *     size_t dim() const;
 *
 * Returns a new T that is a result of updating *this with the delta v after pulling
 * the updated value back to the manifold T.
 *     T retract(const Vector& v) const;
 *
 * Returns the linear coordinates of lp in the tangent space centered around *this.
 *     Vector localCoordinates(const T& lp) const;
 *
 * By convention, we use capital letters to designate a static function
 * @tparam T is a Lie type, like Point2, Pose3, etc.
